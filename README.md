# GeminiPals
Here is the Android Studio codebase of an AI-chatbot named 'GeminiPals' build with Gemini-SDK provided by Google.


Key Features:
1) FOUNDATIONALLY STRONG: A basic AI-chatBot made using Kotlin on Android Studio, that uses Gemini API to process userInput.
2) BUILD WITH GEMINI:  It is linked to GeminiAPI. We can ask anything to it. Say, for example, if we ask for any code, it will provide us with the same.
3)  HISTORY-ENABLED INPUT: Everytime when we send a message, the system shares a previous record of the conversation, making sure for bot to be upto-the-date with every piece of conversation
4) COPY-ENABLED OUTPUT: We can directly, copy the messages(or codes, if needed) from the chatPage directly to our local device, enabling smooth interface.
5) IMPORVED UX: When a user sends a message, the bot first displays a "TYPING..." indicator before providing a response.

You can find the codebase in 'master' branch.
